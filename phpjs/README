1 the php javascript interpreter
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This script code "interpreter" provides a JavaScript-like language,
itself running inside the PHP interpreter (version 4 or later). The
script code it supports is actually a mix of JS and PHP syntax (not
all features can be supported at the same time, but compatibility
completeness is not a goal).

Of course it runs much slower than a real interpreter, because it
itself is written in a scripting language. But it is in fact useful,
because the script code it executes can be user-supplied, as it is
always run safely encapsulated in a sandbox. You can still interface
it with real PHP code and variables by providing interfaces and
references.

Using this technique makes especially sense in high end CMS and
Hypertext Management Systems (WikiEngines), in that you can plug-in
any code supplied through open interfaces without affecting server
security. Speed may in fact suffer (in comparison to native PHP code),
but reducing the administrators work by allowing feature extension of
a site by far outweights this.

NOTE: This is still VERY EARLY ALPHA (in development). For the list
of missing features, please see on top of the "js.php" library.

1.2 acknowledgements
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This interpreter makes use of the techniques Jack W. Crenshaw layed out in
his "Let's build a compiler!" series, which are still available for download
and remain the most interesting lecture on that topic (see also UseNet group
news:comp.compilers).


1.3 license
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 It is FreeWare, which means that it CAN BE USED with/in most projects
 WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTIONS. It may be COPIED, MODIFIED, REDISTRIBUTED
 as long as this paragraph is preserved. This license cannot be auto-
 transformed into GNU GPL. For binary-only distributions(?) this whole
 license shall shape into Public Domain (COMMERCIAL REUSE ALLOWED).

 The author prefers GNU LGPL for anything that resembles a library of
 any sort - that's the reasoning for the GPL discriminating rule. But
 please!, simply contact the author for an exception. And please don't
 call this Anti-GPL, even if it is ;)

 A rewrite of the script in any other programming language (Perl or
 Python e.g.) of course frees it from any licensing issues or previous
 copyright ownerships. (You can then choose your own, as always.)


1.4 why?
    ¯¯¯¯
Hey, someone just had to do it!  ;)

The initial reasoning for this interpreter was to allow interchanging
of extension plugins between different WikiEngines, as it was an
neutral interchange language for the various PHP, Perl and Python
based implementations.

It should be possible to port this to Perl with ease (and even Python
seems feasible), once it is running. So this would clearly allow for
WikiFeatures:AutomaticFeatureInstall and other niceties.







2 usage overview
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The so called interpreter is divided into different parts to make it
easier to load only the appropriate components when neccessary:

  js.php     the core script holds the minimal configuration and
             run time settings, required by all other parts

  jsc.php    contains the compiler (lexer, parser), that transforms
             script source code into 'bytecode'

  jsi.php    is the pure interpreter, which can walk over the bytecode
             and execute and evaluate all commands and expressions it
             finds therein

  jsrt.php   runtime environment for the interpreter, must also be
             loaded to execute scripts; provides interfaces to native
             PHP functions

  jsa.php    holds the accelerator post-compiler, which transforms the
             bytecode into sandboxed PHP code that later can be executed
             without the slower interpreter; does not conflict with jsi,
             but nevertheless is meant as replacement for it

To execute a script you only need to load the "js.php" script, which
will automatically load the other four parts for you. (But you could use
the 'mkbig' utility to join all five into one unified include script.)

The "jsrt.php" is required for both, executing the bytecode via jsi::
or executing the sandbox code produced by the jsa:: converter.


2.1 interfaces
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The interpreter can be activated through different function calls. You
can also only run the compiler and accelerator, if you wish; but for
convinvience you might want to use one of the two combined calls:

   js_exec($src)
   -------------
      Passes the given script string to the parser and then runs the
      interpreter. When the script runs all output will be directly
      output with 'echo'.
      Afterwards the "compiled" bytecode from the original script will
      still be in the global '$bc'.

   $output = js($src)
   ------------------
      Compiles and executes the given script code, but returns its
      output as result string. If no $src string was given, an already
      loaded '$bc' would be used instead.

      Also this call tries to buffer the bytecode in a compressed (.gz)
      serialized format. But see also JS_CACHE on how to control that.


Compiler and interpreter can also be invoked separately, which may be
useful for converting a script into bytecode, buffering it and running
it at a later time (you just needed to load the compiler, and only the
interpreter the other time).

   jsc::compile($src)
   ----------------
      Only compiles the given $src code string into the global '$bc'
      bytecode variable.

   jsi::run()
   ---------
      Executes the "bytecode" loaded in the global '$bc' variable. The
      output generated in that script (with print... or document.write)
      would be directly written to stdout/client (itself uses echo). The
      loaded $bc will be more optimized, once the interpreter run on it.

      Beware that the "jsrt.php" script needs to be loaded before you
      invoke the interpreter, as otherwise no core functions will be
      available (except "print()" which is a language construct).

   jsa::assemble()
   ---------------
      Converts the loaded $bc (or given script source string) into
      sandboxed PHP code for later execution via PHPs eval() construct.
      But please see the "jsa.php" script for that.


2.2 bytecode buffering
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Instead of always passing the js_exec() function a string with source
code to get executed, you should buffer the generated $bc bytecode and
reuse it, if possible.  If you use the simplified js() call and set
JS_CACHE correctly, then this is taken care of on your behalf. If you
however would like to buffer the bytecode yourself, then you would
run the parser/compiler and interpreter parts yourself in individual
steps as follows:

    1)  pass the source code to:

          js_compile($string);

    2)  save the generated pre-bytecode from the global "$bc"
        variable (into a file or database)

    3)  Then execute the compiled program, by loading the
        pre-bytecode back into the global "$bc" variable,
        and calling:

          jsi_run();

        (Of course you wouldn't reload the bytecode from disk
        in the round you had actually generated it.)

As additional hint: You could first let the code run (with jsi_run, js_exec
or js_block), and afterwards save it. This way you would get the optimized
code from $bc (which is still available after return from the interpreter).


2.3 constants/settings
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
There is limited configurability in phpjs, but no real language behaviour
switch until yet (even if JS_PHPMODE suggests this).

JS_CACHE
  is the directory name, which the 'js()' call uses for storing bytecode
  for a given script string to later reuse it
  Note: this directory must usually be world-writable in a webserver
  environment (the shell/ftp thingy with "chmod 777 ..."); ALSO the
  directory should be cleaned if you upgrade from an earlier release,
  because the 'bytecode' constantly changes

JS_DEBUG
  enables a few print_r() and echo() statements throughout the code,
  mainly used for development of the phpjs lib

JS_FAST_CODE
  selects, if the JS_* constants should be defined()
  otherwise PHP will use the JS_* constant names as string scalars,
  which yields larger but more readable bytecode (= eventually slower)

JS_PHPMODE
  is not used yet






3 extending
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The goal of phpjs is to allow integration into existing CMS for
providing a sandboxed access to some of its features.

So, whenever you add functions or variables you should keep in mind,
not to comprimise your server security - or otherwise you could just
have used eval() instead of phpjs. Especially bare *sql_query()
functions shouldn't be made available from within the sandbox - rather
make multiple wrapper functions for accessing small fragments and this
read-only then.

The jsi_mk_runtime_env() function is automatically invoked by jsi_run()
and sets the most basic variables and functions. It however does not
clear $jsi_vars and $jsi_funcs, so you can extend both at any time
(even before a js_exec() call).

For example:
<code>
   $jsi_vars["myvar"] = 37.5;
   js("script...;");
</code>
Would run the given script with the variable "myvar" already defined.


3.1 adding variables
    ----------------
The global $jsi_vars contains an associative array of variable names
and values to be used inside the phpjs runtime/interpreter. You can
add variable names to it, before you invoke jsi_run() [or js_exec()
or others].

You can also create variable references therein, the interpreter and
PHP handle it transparently:

  $jsi_vars["_REQUEST"] = &$_REQUEST;

Would always keep the $_REQUEST array available inside the jscript for
access (=value reading), *and* for modification (= changing $_REQUEST
values).


3.2 adding functions
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Functions must be registered with $jsi_vars AND $jsi_funcs. The $jsi_funcs
array thereby lists the system (PHP) functions, the running phpjs script
may invoke (all others stay inaccessible). But because functions in JS
are also objects/variables you also must list them in $jsi_vars,
associating the JS/script function name to the real PHP function name.

   $jsi_vars["myfunc"] = "php_function_name";
   $jsi_funcs[] = "php_function_name";

But you can also use the interpreter function registration call
(with the first parameter being the script function name, and the
second the real PHP function):

   jsi_register_func("js.my_func", "strip_tags");

From within a registered PHP function, you can then of course modify the
"global" variables of the running script, by simply accessing $jsi_vars
again.

NOTE: parameter pass-by-ref is planned, but not yet implemented.







4 asorted notes
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
See INTERNALS for more in-deep informations on how phpjs operates.


4.1 examples
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The interpreter accepts JavaScript-lookalike code:

   js_exec('
      for (i=0; i<5; $i+=1) 
      {
         document.writeLn("counting up," + " i = " + i);
      }
   ');

But also PHP-like variables mixed in:

   jsi_exec('

      $mytime = system.time;
      x = 1;

      if (x == $x) {
         document.write("The time is: ");
         document.writeLn( $mytime() );
      }

   ');

But please also note the list of missing features on top of the "js.php"
script.


4.2 optimizations
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Source will initially be transformed into an intermediate representation,
a parse tree optimizied (or at least suiteable) for quick (or at least
simple) interpretation (or at least something that way). This "pre-bytecode"
should be stored for later reuse by the embeding application, to prevent
reparsing the scripts each time they were to be run.

It is possible to optimize the generated pre-bytecode. It is further
possible to make real bytecode of it (Parrot, P-Code), though that may
not yield better results at all, because the current way of doing things
in reality lets the PHP engine do the real work (type handling and
auto-conversion are almost like in JavaScript), what is rather speedy.

It already features automatic code optimization during run time (the
pseudo-bytecode gets smaller whenever the interpreter detects
redundancies).


4.3 speed comparisions
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The parser in some tests only took around a fifth of the time required
to execute a script, and the interpreter turned out to be rather fast
in fact. The accelerator (sandboxed PHP code) will of course speed up
the execution even more. However no meaningful tests have been done
yet (what was written previously here was far too code specific).
