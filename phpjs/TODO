- string expansion "...\n...$varname..."
- objects
    could be done by injecting [".type"] settings into array variable
    entries of $js_vars[],
    and a secondary array would serve as mapping of function name vars
    to real php/functions again (the object array entry and the type
    array would simply be merged by jsi_get_var() so the _fcall() needed
    few changes)
- function parameters pass-by-ref, only work for a limited number of args?



future project goals:
  - make this interpreter run itself
  - port the Perl operating system ;)
